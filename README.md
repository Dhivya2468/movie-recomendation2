1. Problem Overview:
Users often face difficulty in discovering movies that align with their personal preferences, moods, or specific interests. Current recommendation systems may not adequately consider nuanced user preferences such as specific genres, directors, or thematic focus areas.

2. Objective:
Develop a personalized movie recommendation system that leverages the TMDb API to provide tailored movie suggestions based on user-defined preferences, integrating content-based filtering, collaborative filtering, and natural language processing techniques.

3. Key Features:

User Preference Input: Allow users to specify their preferences, including genres, directors, moods, and project-related focus areas.

Movie Data Retrieval: Utilize the TMDb API to fetch detailed movie information, including genres, cast, and release dates.

Recommendation Algorithms: Implement content-based filtering to suggest movies with similar attributes and collaborative filtering to recommend movies based on user similarity.

Natural Language Processing: Analyze project descriptions using TF-IDF and cosine similarity to recommend movies with similar themes or storytelling techniques.

Web Interface: Develop a Flask-based web application to interact with users and display recommendations.

4. Technical Components:

Data Collection: Fetch movie data from the TMDb API using Python's requests library.

Data Processing: Process and filter movies based on user preferences using Python's data manipulation capabilities.

Recommendation Engine: Employ machine learning techniques such as Nearest Neighbors for collaborative filtering and TF-IDF vectorization for content-based filtering.

Web Application: Use Flask to create a user-friendly interface for input and display of recommendations.

5. Challenges Addressed:

Cold Start Problem: Mitigate issues arising from new users or items with limited data by combining collaborative and content-based filtering approaches.

Scalability: Design the system to handle a growing number of users and movies efficiently.

Real-Time Updates: Incorporate new movies and user preferences promptly to maintain up-to-date recommendations.
